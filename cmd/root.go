	Use:   "onboarder",
	Short: "Bootstrap your work git repositories.",
	Long: `Onboarder will bootstrap your work git repositories.

Onboarder is an onboarding tool built for the Docs team at MongoDB (initially).

Onboarder generates a new ssh keypair and uploads the public
key to github for you. It will also add it to the ssh-agent, and it modifies
your ~/.ssh/config file (creates if needed) to use the key.

Onboarder also uploads your gpg key to github, and adds it to your
your git config. Commits will be signed by default after using onboarder.

Run onboarder, passing in flags for the output directory where repositories
should be cloned to, and which team you are on.

Current teams are cet, and tdbx. Future versions will accept a config file
rather than have this hardcoded in.

onboarder -t tdbx -o ~/work

The above will fork repos appropriate for the *tdbx* team and then clone
them to the ~/work directory.

There will be a pause between forking and cloning. This is to allow time
for larger repositories to fork.

IMPORTANT: You will be asked a question during the process similar to:

  The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.112.4)' can't be established.
  ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
  This key is not known by any other names
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

You must answer yes to this question. It is adding the fingerprint to your
known_hosts file.


If you have already set up ssh keys, running this tool may be cause an error
with your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. Delete the file and run the tool again.

I'm about to begin forking and cloning all of the repositories that you should need.
I'm also going to create an ssh key for you and add it to your github account.

This may take a while (5-10 minutes) depending on how many repositories I'm
working with. Please be patient.
