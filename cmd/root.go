	Short: "Bootstrap your work git repositories.",
	Long: `Onboarder will bootstrap your work git repositories.

Onboarder is an onboarding tool built for the Docs team at MongoDB.

Onboarder uploads your ssh and  gpg keys to github, and adds it to your
your git config. Commits will be signed by default after using onboarder.

Run onboarder, passing in flags for the output directory where repositories
should be cloned to, the path to your *public* ssh key, your pgp key id,
and the path to the configuration file (provided to you).


onboarder -o ~/work

The above will fork repos appropriate for the *tdbx* team and then clone
them to the ~/work directory.

There will be a pause between forking and cloning. This is to allow time
for larger repositories to fork.

I'm about to begin forking and cloning all of the repositories that you should need.
I'm also going to create an ssh key for you and add it to your github account.

This may take a while (5-10 minutes) depending on how many repositories I'm
working with. Please be patient.
